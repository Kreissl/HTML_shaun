  <p>Curriculum vitae</p>

  <h5><b> Profile </b></h5>

  <p>
    From being a child I had a desire to widen my knowledge and understanding of
    the world. To achieve this, I delved into numerous industries which gave me
    excellent life experience. Now, after being a joiner for most of my adult
    life, I am an aspiring software developer with a hunger to pursue my dreams.
    I am adaptive and diligent when learning new skills and never shy away from
    challenges. When growing up I loved to take things apart and reconstruct
    them. This then developed into laptops and computers and even building and
    upgrading my own. I have an ever growing interest in technology and the
    software behind it. Such that, I have dedicated spare time to learn the
    basics of coding, including some Python, HTML and CSS.

  <h5><b> Experience </b></h5>

  <p>
    <b> Chef, Salt Barge — 2013 – 2015 </b>
    I began working in a restaurant as a waiter and quickly worked my way up to
    head chef. Extensions of my job consisted of writing new menus and finding
    ways to continuously improve the experience for the customer. Skills I
    acquired in the role include customer service skills, the nature of supply
    and demand, adapting to clienteles interests and communication skills.
    <b> Joiner, Lux Development Contractors — 2017 — present </b>
    My current job consists of planning and carrying out start to finish
    construction projects. I have mastered the role of delegation to improve the
    workforce. I regularly create design mock-ups for customers on a computer
    software (Fusion) and build them according to said mock-up. I believe that
    this skill will benefit me when coding websites according to UX designer
    prototypes. Skills acquired include working in a team of other trades
    efficiently, computer skills, time management and integrity.
