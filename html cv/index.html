      <p class="first-paragraph">
        From being a child I had a desire to widen my knowledge and
        understanding of the world. To achieve this, I delved into numerous
        industries which gave me excellent life experience. Now, after being a
        joiner for most of my adult life, I am an aspiring software developer
        with a hunger to pursue my dreams. I am adaptive and diligent when
        learning new skills and never shy away from challenges. When growing up
        I loved to take things apart and reconstruct them. This then developed
        into laptops and computers and even building and upgrading my own. I
        have an ever growing interest in technology and the software behind it.
        Such that, I have dedicated spare time to learn the basics of coding,
        including some Python, HTML and CSS.

        <b> Chef, Salt Barge — 2013 – 2015 </b>
        I began working in a restaurant as a waiter and quickly worked my way up
        to head chef. Extensions of my job consisted of writing new menus and
        finding ways to continuously improve the experience for the customer.
        Skills I acquired in the role include customer service skills, the
        nature of supply and demand, adapting to clienteles interests and
        communication skills.

       <b> Joiner, Lux Development Contractors — 2017 — present </b>

        My current job consists of planning and carrying out start to finish
        construction projects. I have mastered the role of delegation to improve
        the workforce. I regularly create design mock-ups for customers on a
        computer software (Fusion) and build them according to said mock-up. I
        believe that this skill will benefit me when coding websites according
        to UX designer prototypes. Skills acquired include working in a team of
        other trades efficiently, computer skills, time management and
        integrity.
